// We can delete this file or keep it empty/null as the new design uses the "FixedFrame" instead of a top navbar.
// But to avoid breaking imports in layout/page, let's just make it return null for now, 
// or repurpose it as a mobile menu if needed later. 
// For this brutalist design, we usually rely on the FixedFrame.
