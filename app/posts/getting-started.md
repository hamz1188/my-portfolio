# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has become the de-facto framework for building React applications. It offers features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes out of the box.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps catch errors early and improves developer experience through better tooling and autocompletion.

### Key Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
2. **Better IDE Support**: Intelligent code completion
3. **Refactoring**: Easier to change code with confidence

## Code Example

Here is a simple component in Next.js:

```tsx
export default function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
}
```
